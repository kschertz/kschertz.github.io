Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Emotion & Self Control Lab](http://selfcontrol.psych.lsa.umich.edu) at the University of Michigan and the [Clinical Psychophysiology Lab](https://oboe-mouse-keb7.squarespace.com/) at Michigan State University. I completed my PhD in Psychology in the [Environmental Neuroscience Lab](https://voices.uchicago.edu/bermanlab/) at the University of Chicago. I am interested in how the physical environment influences cognition, emotions, behavior, and wellbeing, and the mechanisms of these effects. Specifically, I focus on the influence of natural environments across the urban to rural gradient. I combine experimental psychology methods with spatial data science using big, open datasets in my research.

### Reseach Questions

- How does one's surrounding environment influence who and what they think about?
- What environmental features shape these cognitive and social effects?
- How do neighborhood level physical and social environments affect behavior and mental health?

### Broader Impacts

In an effort to help city-dwellers experience natural stimuli on their daily lives, I co-developed a web-app called [ReTUNE](https://retune.app/) which generates 'restorative' walking routes which account for greenspace, noise levels and crime. The app currently works in pilot form for Chicago and is in the process of being expanded.

### Open Science

Check out my [Open Science Framework page](https://osf.io/hfapn/) for shared stimuli, datasets, and analysis code!
