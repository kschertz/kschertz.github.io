Hello! I am a PhD student in the [Environmental Neuroscience Lab](https://voices.uchicago.edu/bermanlab/) in the Psychology department at the University of Chicago. I am interested in how the physical environment influences cognition and behavior, and the mechanisms of these effects. Specifically, I focus on the influence of natural environments (and natural stimuli in urban environments). I combine experimental psychology methods with spatial data science in my research.

### Current Projects

- what people think about while visiting natural environments
- the relationship between thought content and visual features 
- how park visits, street activity, and tree canopy are related to crime

### Broader Impacts

In an effort to help city-dwellers experience natural stimuli on their daily lives, I co-developed a web-app called [ReTUNE](https://retune-56d2e.firebaseapp.com/) which generates 'restorative' walking routes which account for greenspace, noise levels and crime. The app currently works for the Hyde Park/Kenwood/Woodlawn area of Chicago and is in the process of being expanded.

### Open Science

Check out my [Open Science Framework page](https://osf.io/hfapn/) for shared stimuli and analysis code!
