Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Emotion & Self Control Lab](http://selfcontrol.psych.lsa.umich.edu) in the Psychology department of the University of Michigan. I completed my PhD in the [Environmental Neuroscience Lab](https://voices.uchicago.edu/bermanlab/) at the University of Chicago. I am interested in how the physical environment influences cognition, emotions, and behavior, and the mechanisms of these effects. Specifically, I focus on the influence of natural environments (and natural stimuli in urban environments). I combine experimental psychology methods with spatial data science in my research.

### Current Projects

- what people think about while visiting natural environments
- the relationship between thought content and visual features 
- how interactions with the physical and social environment influence crime

### Broader Impacts

In an effort to help city-dwellers experience natural stimuli on their daily lives, I co-developed a web-app called [ReTUNE](https://retune-56d2e.firebaseapp.com/) which generates 'restorative' walking routes which account for greenspace, noise levels and crime. The app currently works for the Hyde Park/Kenwood/Woodlawn area of Chicago and is in the process of being expanded.

### Open Science

Check out my [Open Science Framework page](https://osf.io/hfapn/) for shared stimuli, datasets, and analysis code!
